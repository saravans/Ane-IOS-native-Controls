=======================

Adobe Air Native extension to access iOS native controls like table view


its a begining. tried to access UItableView in adobe air using native extention.

As for i understood entire Adobe air application is running in a single view and controlled by rootviewcontroller (UIViewController)

i just added one more view in the root view controller.

Soon will update the native navigation controller to the Ane ..

trying some stupid things.....happy coding.....
